## Motivation
A recreation of the Space Invaders arcade game made in native Java 7. The entire project is self contained, utilizing Java's Swing and AWT libraries. The goal of this project was to build a gaming framework that is native to Java for future projects.

## Setup
In order to run the game you can either download it from the [release page](https://github.com/NubPaws/JavaSpaceInvaders/releases/tag/Release) or you can compile it yourself.

### Compilation
You'll need
* Java 7 or higher.
  * `apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk` (I'd recommend at least java 8).
* Apache's ANT
  * `apt-get install ant`

To compile the project:
1. Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/NubPaws/JavaSpaceInvaders.git`.
2. Compile and run using `ant run`.
